icepack is a library for modeling the flow of ice sheets and glaciers using the finite element method.
For more information and installation instructions, see the [project webpage](https://icepack.github.io).
Once you've installed icepack, the directory `notebooks/tutorials/` contains several Jupyter notebooks with demonstrations of the main features of icepack to get you started.
The directory `notebooks/how-to` contains more advanced material for when you've got a good feel for how things work.
Some of these demos use real data, for which you'll need to have an account with [NASA EarthData](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/).

See also [firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org), a finite element modeling package used to implement the solvers in icepack.
